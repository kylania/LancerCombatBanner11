# What is this? 

Lancer Combat Banner is a module that adds a visual display whenever the round changes and whenever a unit is activated. 

# Features

Color automatically changes with player and GM color. This can be overridden with a settings-defined color for all banners. 

Also creates a chat message when a character is activated in the combat tracker, and when a new round begins. This can be disabled in the settings.

# Maintenance

Any bugs should be [reported here](https://github.com/hiddenkrypt/LancerCombatBanner/issues) on github.
